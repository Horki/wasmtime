This makes it possible to use the Interpreter in a range of situations: - when interpretation requires understanding all of the ways state can change (e.g. loading and storing from the heap) we will use a full-fledged state, like InterpreterState. - when interpretation can ignore some state changes (e.g. abstract interpretation of arithmetic instructions--no heap knowledge required), we can partially implement this trait. See [ImmutableRegisterState] for an example of this: it only exposes the values referenced by the SSA references in the current frame and not much else."]]});
